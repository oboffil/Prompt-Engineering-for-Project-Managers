## ⚠️ Data Privacy Reminder  
AI models process and learn from the input provided. **Never share sensitive, confidential, or proprietary company data with open-source AI models.**  

- If your company provides an **internal AI model**, use it instead.  
- If using a public AI tool, **reframe prompts** to only include general, non-confidential information.  
- Avoid inputting **customer details, financial records, personal data, or internal strategy documents**.
